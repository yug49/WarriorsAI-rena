/**
 * MESSAGE_FOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY is a fixed message used to derive the encryption key.
 *
 * Background:
 * To ensure a consistent and unique encryption key can be generated from a user's Ethereum wallet,
 * we utilize a fixed message combined with a signing mechanism.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - This string is provided to the Ethereum signing function to generate a digital signature based on the user's private key.
 * - The produced signature is then hashed (using SHA-256) to create a consistent 256-bit encryption key from the same wallet.
 * - This process offers a way to protect data without storing additional keys.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The uniqueness and stability of this message are crucial; do not change it unless you fully understand the impact
 *   on the key derivation and encryption process.
 * - Because the signature is derived from the wallet's private key, it ensures that different wallets cannot produce the same key.
